# riak-js

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) client for [Riak](http://riak.basho.com) with support for HTTP and Protocol Buffers.

### Installation

    npm install riak-js@latest

### Development

If you clone the repository or download a tarball from github you will need CoffeeScript.

It can be installed via `brew install coffee-script` or `npm install coffee-script`.

Simply execute `cake dev` to start continuous compilation. You may also want to run `npm link` so that whenever you call `require('riak-js')` it will always point to the current dev version.

Test with `cake test` or `cake -s test`. Requires [Vows](http://vowsjs.org) 0.5.2.
